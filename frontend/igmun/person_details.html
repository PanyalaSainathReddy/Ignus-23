Moreover, Heanish being a part of over 70 Model United Nations conferences across five countries, hopes to assist delegates through his vast experience.

        "A sunset lover, surviving on aesthetics, daydreaming and classic Bollywood movies. I can't explain, but I can find a movie that can." A hodophile and bibliophile, she is as smitten with blue skies and sunsets as with honest conversations over a good cup of coffee. Having discovered MUNs in high school, Anagha has since taken part in various MUNs as a delegate, a secretariat member and as a part of the executive board. She specialises in humanitarian committees and can generally be found in UNHRCs and UNGAs. She believes that MUN'ing is the perfect way to get to know people on a deeper level: although you represent something, your MUN style tells a lot about you. She is a law aspirant who has been part of the MUNning circuit for the last four years. She is a passionate debater who values research and analysis over everything else and looks to provide the delegates with an unforgivable experience at IGMUN.
